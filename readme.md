# iOS 6 Calculator
This project is a small calculator made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript that tend to badly copy the design of the iOS6 Calculator app.

This was made for school as an exercise.

The code is very rudimentary as it is my very first project using JavaScript, coding on my own.

Enjoy some free nostalgia.
